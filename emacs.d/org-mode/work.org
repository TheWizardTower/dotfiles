to-do:
1 - launch fcl_server. fuck.
1a - Make sure it's set to the right serial baud rate -- 115200.
2 - copy over fcx.exe from FCX\bin\Release to FCX\Regression\
3 - copy over all DLL's from FCX\bin\Release to FCX\Regression
4 - Run Tests. (note: Make the 'gold standard' diff files match up the configuration on the Jenkins server)
5 - Somehow clean up fcl_server.
